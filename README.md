# Aguamarina
Aguamarina is a package manager for legacy versions of android forked from Aptoide, supporting most legacy Android versions, including Android 1.0, though it will likely not work as intended on newer Android versions.

## Why?
Legacy iOS versions have a thriving community of sideloaders, with Cydia acting as the definitive package manager.

Legacy Android versions do not have a thriving community at all, with existing package managers like Aptoide, APKtor and F-Droid being difficult to create repositories for on modern computers and not being very accessible. Aguamarina aims to fix these issues and possibly help start a bigger community of legacy Android users.

## How do I make a repository?
Using the [Berilo Rojo](https://github.com/AguamarinaPR/BeriloRojo) php scripts, you can generate a repository.
Repositories consist of 2 XML files (info.xml and extras.xml), apks and icons.
A user can add your repo to their Aguamarina client easily.
