# 1. What is this?
The Aguamarina project is committed to finding ways to combat E-waste and help the earth, and as such, also avoids using AI.
Aguamarina's "Code of Conduct" are some of the requests made by **Nossa Senhora de Fátima** when she appeared to the three santos pastorinhos six times in 1917, a year after the Angel of Portugal appeared to them.

# 2. Clarification
You are **NOT REQUIRED** to follow or believe the requests of **Nossa Senhora de Fátima** are good in order to contribute to or use Aguamarina, I only demand of you that you **do not use AI in making your contributions** and **avoid causing unnecessary trouble to the project and community**. I cannot and will not force you to believe that the requests of **Nossa Senhora de Fátima** are good, but I believe that if you comply with them, you can be closer to achieving a state of grace.

# 3. Pedidos de Nossa Senhora de Fátima
1. Pray the Rosary, every day, to reach peace for the world and the end of the war.
2. When you pray the Rosary, say after every mystery: “O my **Jesus**, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to Heaven, especially those that are most in need”.
3. Pray, pray much and make sacrifices for the sinners, as many souls are going to hell because of there not being people to sacrifice and pray for them.
4. Do not offend **Our Lord** more, He is already much offended!

Of the requests made by **Nossa Senhora** at Fátima, I chose to include these four as they are the most relevant to the average layman. You are not vanished from the project for failing in following these, these are a suggestion on my part. I only demand of you that you do not use AI in making your contributions and avoid causing unnecessary trouble to the project and community.
